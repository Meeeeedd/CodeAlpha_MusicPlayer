Secure Music Player Application
This is a simple music player application built with HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS for utility, custom CSS for specifics), JavaScript, and a Node.js/Express backend. It features basic music controls, playlist management, and integrates with the Gemini API to provide artist insights, demonstrating a more secure way to handle API keys by proxying requests through the backend.

Features
Music Playback: Play, pause, next, previous song functionality.

Song Information: Displays song title, artist, and duration.

Progress & Volume Control: Interactive sliders for tracking progress and adjusting volume.

Dynamic Playlist: Loads playlist data from the backend.

Autoplay: Automatically plays the next song when the current one ends.

Artist Insights (Gemini API Integration):

Click a button to get a concise overview of the current artist using the Gemini API.

API key is securely stored and used on the backend (server.js), protecting it from client-side exposure.

Responsive Design: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for a modern and mobile-friendly interface.

Basic Security: Uses helmet middleware for basic HTTP header security.

Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js)

A Gemini API Key (get one from Google AI Studio)

Steps
Clone or Download the Project:
If you're starting from scratch, create a new folder named Music_Player and place the public/, server.js, .env, and README.md files inside it according to the structure above.

Navigate to the Project Directory:
Open your terminal or command prompt and go into the Music_Player folder:

cd Music_Player


Install Dependencies:
Install the necessary Node.js packages (express, dotenv, helmet, cors, node-fetch):

npm install express dotenv helmet cors node-fetch


Configure Environment Variables:
Create a file named .env in the root of your Music_Player directory (at the same level as server.js).
Add your Gemini API key to this file:

GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
PORT=3000


Replace YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE with your actual Gemini API key.

Security Note: The .env file should never be committed to version control (e.g., Git). Add .env to your .gitignore file if you are using Git.

Run the Server:
Start the Node.js Express server:

node server.js


You should see output similar to:

Server running at http://localhost:3000
Music Player frontend available at http://localhost:3000/index.html


Access the Application:
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/index.html.

Important Notes for Deployment
API Key Security: The current setup proxies the Gemini API requests through your backend, which is a good security practice. Your GEMINI_API_KEY is not exposed in the client-side code.

CORS: The cors() middleware is currently configured to allow requests from any origin. For production deployments, you should restrict this to your specific frontend domain(s) to prevent unauthorized access to your API.
Example for server.js (replace with your actual domain):

app.use(cors({
    origin: 'https://your-frontend-domain.com'
}));


Content Security Policy (CSP): helmet is used but contentSecurityPolicy is disabled. For a production environment, it's highly recommended to enable and configure a strict CSP to mitigate XSS attacks. This requires careful configuration based on all external resources your app uses.

Audio File Hosting: For production, consider hosting your actual audio files on a CDN (Content Delivery Network) or a dedicated media storage service (e.g., Google Cloud Storage, AWS S3) rather than directly serving them from your Express server for better performance and scalability.

Error Handling & Logging: Implement more robust error handling and logging mechanisms in your server.js for production monitoring.

HTTPS: Always use HTTPS in production. You'll typically configure this at your hosting provider or with a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Apache).

Scalability: For high-traffic applications, consider load balancing and scaling your Node.js application.
